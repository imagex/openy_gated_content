## About
This module provides a Gated Content Authentication Provider for the Daxko
 Barcode integration.

## How to use this integration.

1. Enable this module.
2. OPTIONAL (but highly recommended): configure reCaptcha settings at
`/admin/config/people/captcha/recaptcha`.
2. Add your validation secret and form url and check help messages at
`/admin/openy/virtual-ymca/gc-auth-settings/provider/daxkobarcode`.
3. Save your settings.
4. Set Daxko Barcode as your main authorization plugin
at the Virtual YMCA settings: `/admin/openy/openy-gc-auth/settings`.
