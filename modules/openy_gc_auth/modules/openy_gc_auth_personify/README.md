### How to configure your Personify for Virtual Y

/SSO_IMS_Admin/AdminLogin.aspx
1.2 Under SSO vendor Click -&gt; New
1.2.1 Create SSO Account

1.2.2 Assign Access to Web Services

1.2.2.1 Open SSO Account created in earlier step

1.2.2.2 Scroll down and Grant access to: (If any of these calls are missing in your
environment, please log a support case with Personify/contact your
project manager)

  - a). **SSOCustomerTokenIsValid** : Verifies that the Customer&#39;s token is
valid. Tokens are single use, therefore a new token will be
returned if the provided token is valid.
  - b). **VendorTokenEncrypt**: Returns the encrypted Vendor token. This
method allows a Vendor to create a valid token without having to
implement Rijndael encryption.
  - c). **CustomerTokenDecrypt**: Returns the decrypted Customer token.
This method allows a Vendor to decrypt a Customer Token without
having to implement Rijndael decryption.
  - d). **SSOCustomerGetByCustomerToken**: Returns SSO Customer

customer information by Customer Token.
  - e) **TIMSSCustomerIdentifierGet**: This allows the TIMSS Vendor to
set TIMSS customer ID for SSO Customer.

#### 2. Create Personify DataServices credentials

**The end point is &lt;Your ebuzinessdomain&gt;/PersonifyDataServices/PersonifyData.svc**

The login credentials are a standard Personify user login created from P360 -&gt; Security -&gt; User
and Group Setup -&gt; User Setup

**Note:**

1. **Suggested username: OpenY.Integration**
2. Assign the minimum permission needed to login.

#### 3. Stored Procedure

The custom stored procedure **[usr_OpenY_Member_Access]** is used to verify if the user logging in is a member that is allowed to access the Virtual membership.

The stored procedure returns “APPROVED” for members who have an order in the Membership subsystem that matches ALL the conditions below:
- Has a product with a product class of “DUES”
- Has a line status code of either A (Active), T (Term at end) or G (Grace)
- Has a fulfill status code of either A (Active), T (Term at end) or G (Grace)
- Has a Grace date >= today

The procedure will “Approve” the Ship-To Member on the order and members on the membership order (from the ORDER_MBR_ASSOCIATE) table. If the conditions above are not met, the stored procedure will return “DENIED”

**ACTION NEEDED**

- use this SQL-procedure code as starting point:https://gist.github.com/anpolimus/b3788f1ac4b54962a6c43f798104fde7
- Make any changes to the business logic that many be needed for your association
- Open a ticket to Personify support to create the stored procedure on your environment or work with your project/account manager as needed.
